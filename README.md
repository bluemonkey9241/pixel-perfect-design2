# Pixel perfect responsive design using BEM methodology

An example of pixel perfect responsive design based on BEM methodology on which I have been working recently.

The requirements:
1. Implement accurately the design in HTML/CSS for the latest Chrome and Firefox versions.
2. Making the layout responsive including the dialogs. 
3. Make the CSS reusable and modular.

Execution:
1. I used Adobe Photoshop Measurement features and rules for getting accurate dimensions of component designs. ZoomPlus magnifier has been used for naked eyes verification. I also used image tracing techniques to determinate font sizes.
2. The coding has been done using a desktop-first approach, the responsive layout for the tablet version is based on CSS3 Media Queries.
3. For CSS modularity and reusability I have chosen [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/).
BEM – meaning block, element, modifier – is a front-end naming methodology. It is a smart way of naming CSS classes to give them more transparency and meaning and it is especially useful for creating reusable UI components.

Notes:
- The original designs are situated in the `mockups` folder.
